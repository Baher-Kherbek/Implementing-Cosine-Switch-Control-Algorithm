# Implementing-Cosine-Switch-Control-Algorithm
A Mobile Robot Control Algorithm Called Cosine Switch Control is implemented.

<h2> The Project </h2>
The Control Algorithm is based on a scientific paper published titled: "Steering Nonholonomic Systems with Cosine Switch Control". After I came across the paper, I felt curious on implementing it on one of my Differential Drive mobile Robots (That were modeled and designed in my 3rd year semester project). The first Script is a simulation of the system based on the mathematical formulas portrayed in the paper, along with basic differential drive mobile Robot kinematics. The second script is a visualization of the robot movement using the turtlesim package available in ROS Noetic. the main.py file is the main node that controls the the robot, the ROS node calculates the specific velocities for each motor and transmits the results to the microcontroller using the ROSSERIAL package (using XMLRPC communication protocol). The Microcontrollers then executes these velocities that were calculated and recieved from the main node. The input parameters for the robot in the video uploaded were the same parameters given to the robot in the paper published, and the results were both identical between my robot and theirs.
